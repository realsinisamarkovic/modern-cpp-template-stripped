# Modern C++ Template

A quick C++ template for modern CMake projects, aimed to be an easy to use
starting point.

Forked from: [https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template](https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template)

Stripped away conan2, catch2 and Github workflows to make the template simpler. Added CMakePresets.json as I mostly use Visual Studio Code as my IDE.
